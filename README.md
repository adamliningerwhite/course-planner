PROJECT UPDATES FOR OSBORN 

Completed Tasks
<ul> 
  <li> Built Java GUI application to collect students' schedule preferences and translate into prolog facts in an lp file. </li>
  <li> Created list of CS classes + generic filler classes to implement scheduler (will replace with actual course data if we ever hear back from ASPC). </li>
  <li> Began implementing course picker/planner in ASP. We outlined all the constraints we need to implement and coded a couple of them. </li> 
</ul> 

In progress
<ul> 
  <li> Figuring out how to code prerequisites into the program and make sure none are violated. </li>
  <li> Adding major requirements and creating schedules that help students to graduate on time. </li> 
</ul>

TODO 
<ul> 
  <li> Integrating pieces of the project so we don't need to run each individually before progressing. </li>
  <li> Displaying schedules in a way that is clean and understandable. </li>
</ul>
