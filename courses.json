    "courseDescription": "This course covers how language and human movement have been intertwined over time, from early human dispersals through modern migrations. We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like \"the market\" and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay and uses films alongside readings to explore each unit's key topics.",

While the experience of art is often framed in terms of seeing, the other senses were crucially involved in the creation of buildings and objects in the medieval and early modern periods, just as they are in the work of present-day artists: think Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms. Textiles and ceramic vessels invite touch, gardens involve the smell of flowers, sacred spaces were built to amplify the sound of prayers and chants. This class will examine how multisensory experience operates in the medieval and early modern arts of Eurasia, and how it can be experienced today, both in historical objects and contemporary art. Readings will range from medieval poetry and multisensory art histories to contemporary discussions of the senses in design and anthropology. Digital Humanities will be part of the course experience.

Topics might include: the rise in chronic diseases and associated health disparities; the hazards and benefits of vaccination programs; obesity, food policy, nutrition, and preventative medicine; environmental conditions impacting the incidence of allergic, autoimmune and malignant diseases; epigenetic regulation of health and vulnerable populations; and the social justice of patient access to medications, medical interventions or clinical trials.

Students will gain knowledge of current trends in genomic and transcriptomic science through a review of relevant literature, facilitated by interactive class discussion. The main objective of the course is for students to develop, through experiential learning, the skills to effectively handle and analyze the large sequencing datasets associated with transcriptomic and genomic studies. By the end of the course, students will be able to properly design, execute and analyze both transcriptomic and genomic experiments, with full knowledge of replication considerations, application of appropriate sequencing methods and effort for the question at hand and full critical analysis of the dataset to answer the biological question. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: BIOL041C PO or BIOL041E PO.",

Through a guided investigation of a set of related journal articles, students will develop their ability to decipher figures, interpret findings, and propose and defend further experiments to test their own hypotheses and questions. This course is aimed at second-year students and no prior experience with primary literature is expected. The journal articles selected will be from the interface of chemistry and biology; topics may include: nucleic acid-based therapeutics, regulatory RNAs, or microbial pathogenesis.
